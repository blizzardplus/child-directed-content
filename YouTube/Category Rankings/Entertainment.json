Worst of all, they were pranked! They were actually in the Las Vegas desert the whole time! Now they must walk all the way back to the city and do a 24 hours overnight challenge in real life. They found a secret hidden camping tent but there was a hacker inside! He took off his mask for a shadow face reveal! We decided to sleep in the tent until morning.

Funny DIY Pranks Battle on Spy Ninjas Friends at Safe House!", "description": "After Chad Wild Clay made the video \"CWC vs Vy Qwaint in Extreme Desert Challenge as Chad is Undercover Friend of Hacker for 24 Hours\", Vy Qwaint created \"I SPEND 24 HOURS in HACKERS TENT! Surprising My Spy Ninjas with Camping Overnight Challenge\" and Daniel uploaded \"Confused Hackers Don't Know Spy Ninjas? Best Friends Chad & Daniel Undercover in Giant Desert\" to the Exposing Project Zorgo YouTube channel, the hackers managed to capture all of the Spy Ninjas and ship them to Abu Dhabi where Vidcon was taking place before it was canceled! After being in a PZ pick up truck, Chad tried to defeat the hackers using the sand monster disguise but it didn't work. The hackers defeated the Spy Ninjas as well as Melvin's egg Al Beauman. Worst of all, they were pranked! They were actually in the Las Vegas desert the whole time! Now they must walk all the way back to the city and do a 24 hours overnight challenge in real life. They found a secret hidden camping tent but there was a hacker inside! He took off his mask for a shadow face reveal! We decided to sleep in the tent until morning. We played fun games and told stories but Melvin is acting very suspicious. We even saw Joseph Banks and perhaps even Mr. E! I hope we can spend the night in the wilderness without any battle royales! When we returned home to the safe house there was a giant present. To decide who gets to open the gift, the Spy Ninjas decide to compete in a Prank War Challenge!\n\nThank you for watching my funny entertainment comedy vlog videos in 2020!\n\nWatch my friend\u2019s awesome videos:\n\nPreston - 10 Ways to Prank Unspeakable's House! *funny*\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXiOGpDWIy4\n\n123 GO!

She\u2019s walking into the house with another brand-new designer hand bag. My dad would go ballistic if he found out she\u2019s been spending money on purses again. My mom has a serious shopping addiction. She tries to hide it from us, but she talks to her fancy friends about it all the time. She thinks I can\u2019t hear her because I\u2019m deaf. Well, surprise, I can!\nSince I was seven years old, my hearing started to deteriorate. It\u2019s because of a rare ear disease. By the age of ten \u2013 I was completely deaf. We tried operations and treatments, but nothing worked.\nI had to go to a school for students with hearing and sight disabilities. It was extremely traumatic. I had to learn sign language and reading lips. Luckily, I made a few good friends.\nI felt really miserable. One day, during breaktime, I fell to the ground in tears. I couldn\u2019t believe that I would never be able to listen to music again, or hear anyone\u2019s voice.  My friend, Rosie, pulled me to the side.  She was acting really strange. \u201cI have a secret!\u201d She mouthed.\nFrom her pocket she took a hearing aid. \u201cIt\u2019s really powerful\u201d she mouthed. \u201cGive it a try.\u201d At first, I was hesitant, but what did I have to lose. To my shock!  It worked! I could hear birds, and cars, I could hear Rosie laughing. It was a miracle. Rosie gave it to me and said, \u201ckeep it until you feel a  bit better.\u201d\nI decided not to tell my parents about it. I was sure they knew something like this existed and they never bothered to buy me one. Also, I wanted to know if they kept anything from me. That night I could hear my parents fighting about money and purses. \u201cI\u2019m making all the money, and you\u2019re spending it on handbags!\u201d said my dad. \u201cOh, Honey, it doesn\u2019t cost that much, you know that! It\u2019s all for the show!\u201d\n Even though it was really great to hear again, I didn\u2019t like listening to my parents fighting. But nothing could prepare me for the secrets that I would find out next.\n That night my parents got all dressed up. My mom was showing off her new glittering designer dress and matching shoes. Off they went to a fancy dinner at some rich guy\u2019s house. My dad was only a small shop manager, and my mother stayed at home. Where did they get all that money from?   \n Luckily, I was old enough and didn\u2019t need a babysitter. I watched some TV, with the sound turned to full volume. Suddenly there was a knock at the door. I got a fright, and switched off the TV. The knock became louder and louder.\n I looked through the peephole, it was a lady. She seemed distressed. \u201cIt\u2019s Mia, open up! Open up! They\u2019re looking for me!\u201d Everything in my body told me not to open the door. But I did it anyway.\n I had my sign nearby, \u201cI can\u2019t hear you, I\u2019m deaf.\u201d I showed it to the lady as she forced her way in . She was going on a total rant about purses, and something about the police, and where my parents were.\n She looked as though she hasn\u2019t slept in days, I guided her to the couch.  She seemed harmless, so I made her a cup of tea and gave her some left over pizza. She said, \u201cthank you\u201d but I shrugged my shoulders, pretending not to know what she was saying.\n In a matter of moments, the lady fell asleep. She was snoring so loudly. Finally, my parents came into the house. They were arguing again. My mom said, \u201cIf you didn\u2019t give it all away, we\u2019d be rich by now!\u201d to which my dad replied, \u201cIf you have just stuck to the plan, I wouldn\u2019t have given it away.\u201d\n Then they saw me, \u201cHoney, you\u2019re still awake?\u201d I pointed to the sofa. My mom was completely shocked, \u201cMia! Mia! What are you doing here?\u201d My dad used sign language to tell me that it was my mom\u2019s childhood friend. Then he told me to go to my room. So, I did.\nI tried to listen to my parents, and what they were saying, when something really weird happened. My hearing aid started to buzz. It made these strange noises, like a radio tuning into a station. Was I picking up signals?\n \u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem like Mia will be coming out of that house tonight.\u201d I quickly jumped to look out of the window. A black SUV was standing outside. Two men were sitting in the front. It looked like one had a hand radio. I heard them talking, \u201cLet\u2019s go, we can catch up with her tomorrow. We don\u2019t want them seeing us.\u201d The SUV drove off.\n A few moments after the two guys left, I could see my parents and Mia walking to her car. They opened the boot and removed 5 big black bags from it.

She\u2019s walking into the house with another brand-new designer hand bag. My dad would go ballistic if he found out she\u2019s been spending money on purses again. My mom has a serious shopping addiction. She tries to hide it from us, but she talks to her fancy friends about it all the time. She thinks I can\u2019t hear her because I\u2019m deaf. Well, surprise, I can!\nSince I was seven years old, my hearing started to deteriorate. It\u2019s because of a rare ear disease. By the age of ten \u2013 I was completely deaf. We tried operations and treatments, but nothing worked.\nI had to go to a school for students with hearing and sight disabilities. It was extremely traumatic. I had to learn sign language and reading lips. Luckily, I made a few good friends.\nI felt really miserable. One day, during breaktime, I fell to the ground in tears. I couldn\u2019t believe that I would never be able to listen to music again, or hear anyone\u2019s voice.  My friend, Rosie, pulled me to the side.  She was acting really strange. \u201cI have a secret!\u201d She mouthed.\nFrom her pocket she took a hearing aid. \u201cIt\u2019s really powerful\u201d she mouthed. \u201cGive it a try.\u201d At first, I was hesitant, but what did I have to lose. To my shock!  It worked! I could hear birds, and cars, I could hear Rosie laughing. It was a miracle. Rosie gave it to me and said, \u201ckeep it until you feel a  bit better.\u201d\nI decided not to tell my parents about it.
