I couldn\u2019t believe that I would never be able to listen to music again, or hear anyone\u2019s voice.  My friend, Rosie, pulled me to the side.  She was acting really strange. \u201cI have a secret!\u201d She mouthed.\nFrom her pocket she took a hearing aid. \u201cIt\u2019s really powerful\u201d she mouthed. \u201cGive it a try.\u201d At first, I was hesitant, but what did I have to lose. To my shock!  It worked! I could hear birds, and cars, I could hear Rosie laughing. It was a miracle. Rosie gave it to me and said, \u201ckeep it until you feel a  bit better.\u201d\nI decided not to tell my parents about it. I was sure they knew something like this existed and they never bothered to buy me one. Also, I wanted to know if they kept anything from me. That night I could hear my parents fighting about money and purses. \u201cI\u2019m making all the money, and you\u2019re spending it on handbags!\u201d said my dad. \u201cOh, Honey, it doesn\u2019t cost that much, you know that! It\u2019s all for the show!\u201d\n Even though it was really great to hear again, I didn\u2019t like listening to my parents fighting. But nothing could prepare me for the secrets that I would find out next.\n That night my parents got all dressed up. My mom was showing off her new glittering designer dress and matching shoes. Off they went to a fancy dinner at some rich guy\u2019s house. My dad was only a small shop manager, and my mother stayed at home. Where did they get all that money from?   \n Luckily, I was old enough and didn\u2019t need a babysitter. I watched some TV, with the sound turned to full volume. Suddenly there was a knock at the door. I got a fright, and switched off the TV. The knock became louder and louder.\n I looked through the peephole, it was a lady. She seemed distressed. \u201cIt\u2019s Mia, open up! Open up! They\u2019re looking for me!\u201d Everything in my body told me not to open the door. But I did it anyway.\n I had my sign nearby, \u201cI can\u2019t hear you, I\u2019m deaf.\u201d I showed it to the lady as she forced her way in . She was going on a total rant about purses, and something about the police, and where my parents were.\n She looked as though she hasn\u2019t slept in days, I guided her to the couch.  She seemed harmless, so I made her a cup of tea and gave her some left over pizza. She said, \u201cthank you\u201d but I shrugged my shoulders, pretending not to know what she was saying.\n In a matter of moments, the lady fell asleep. She was snoring so loudly. Finally, my parents came into the house. They were arguing again. My mom said, \u201cIf you didn\u2019t give it all away, we\u2019d be rich by now!\u201d to which my dad replied, \u201cIf you have just stuck to the plan, I wouldn\u2019t have given it away.\u201d\n Then they saw me, \u201cHoney, you\u2019re still awake?\u201d I pointed to the sofa. My mom was completely shocked, \u201cMia! Mia! What are you doing here?\u201d My dad used sign language to tell me that it was my mom\u2019s childhood friend. Then he told me to go to my room. So, I did.\nI tried to listen to my parents, and what they were saying, when something really weird happened. My hearing aid started to buzz. It made these strange noises, like a radio tuning into a station. Was I picking up signals?\n \u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem like Mia will be coming out of that house tonight.\u201d I quickly jumped to look out of the window. A black SUV was standing outside. Two men were sitting in the front. It looked like one had a hand radio. I heard them talking, \u201cLet\u2019s go, we can catch up with her tomorrow. We don\u2019t want them seeing us.\u201d The SUV drove off.\n A few moments after the two guys left, I could see my parents and Mia walking to her car. They opened the boot and removed 5 big black bags from it. My dad said, \u201cWe\u2019ll keep them in the safe.\u201d", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bQfihyd99C8/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bQfihyd99C8/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bQfihyd99C8/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bQfihyd99C8/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bQfihyd99C8/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "channelTitle": "My Story Animated", "tags": ["my story animated", "short story", "animation", "video animation", "actually happened", "animated story", "animation short film", "animated", "story animated", "hearing aid", "deaf", "secret", "safe", "money", "big safe"], "categoryId": "1", "liveBroadcastContent": "none", "defaultLanguage": "en", "localized": {"title": "I Used Hearing Aid Secretly", "description": "I can\u2019t believe my mom would do this again.

I was sure they knew something like this existed and they never bothered to buy me one. Also, I wanted to know if they kept anything from me. That night I could hear my parents fighting about money and purses. \u201cI\u2019m making all the money, and you\u2019re spending it on handbags!\u201d said my dad. \u201cOh, Honey, it doesn\u2019t cost that much, you know that! It\u2019s all for the show!\u201d\n Even though it was really great to hear again, I didn\u2019t like listening to my parents fighting. But nothing could prepare me for the secrets that I would find out next.\n That night my parents got all dressed up. My mom was showing off her new glittering designer dress and matching shoes. Off they went to a fancy dinner at some rich guy\u2019s house. My dad was only a small shop manager, and my mother stayed at home. Where did they get all that money from?   \n Luckily, I was old enough and didn\u2019t need a babysitter. I watched some TV, with the sound turned to full volume. Suddenly there was a knock at the door. I got a fright, and switched off the TV. The knock became louder and louder.\n I looked through the peephole, it was a lady. She seemed distressed. \u201cIt\u2019s Mia, open up! Open up! They\u2019re looking for me!\u201d Everything in my body told me not to open the door. But I did it anyway.\n I had my sign nearby, \u201cI can\u2019t hear you, I\u2019m deaf.\u201d I showed it to the lady as she forced her way in . She was going on a total rant about purses, and something about the police, and where my parents were.\n She looked as though she hasn\u2019t slept in days, I guided her to the couch.  She seemed harmless, so I made her a cup of tea and gave her some left over pizza. She said, \u201cthank you\u201d but I shrugged my shoulders, pretending not to know what she was saying.\n In a matter of moments, the lady fell asleep. She was snoring so loudly. Finally, my parents came into the house. They were arguing again. My mom said, \u201cIf you didn\u2019t give it all away, we\u2019d be rich by now!\u201d to which my dad replied, \u201cIf you have just stuck to the plan, I wouldn\u2019t have given it away.\u201d\n Then they saw me, \u201cHoney, you\u2019re still awake?\u201d I pointed to the sofa. My mom was completely shocked, \u201cMia! Mia! What are you doing here?\u201d My dad used sign language to tell me that it was my mom\u2019s childhood friend. Then he told me to go to my room. So, I did.\nI tried to listen to my parents, and what they were saying, when something really weird happened. My hearing aid started to buzz. It made these strange noises, like a radio tuning into a station. Was I picking up signals?\n \u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem like Mia will be coming out of that house tonight.\u201d I quickly jumped to look out of the window. A black SUV was standing outside. Two men were sitting in the front. It looked like one had a hand radio. I heard them talking, \u201cLet\u2019s go, we can catch up with her tomorrow. We don\u2019t want them seeing us.\u201d The SUV drove off.\n A few moments after the two guys left, I could see my parents and Mia walking to her car. They opened the boot and removed 5 big black bags from it. My dad said, \u201cWe\u2019ll keep them in the safe.\u201d"}, "defaultAudioLanguage": "en"}, "contentDetails": {"duration": "PT10M2S", "dimension": "2d", "definition": "hd", "caption": "false", "licensedContent": true, "contentRating": {}, "projection": "rectangular"}, "statistics": {"viewCount": "2441234", "likeCount": "55000", "dislikeCount": "2789", "favoriteCount": "0", "commentCount": "3179"}}, {"kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "AD2UY_hEspeWuGJqidjfOY-qRDk", "id": "jEExcR41NTQ", "snippet": {"publishedAt": "2020-04-07T16:37:04Z", "channelId": "UC-lHJZR3Gqxm24_Vd_AJ5Yw", "title": "6 Vegans Vs 1 Meat Eater", "description": "vegan now lads\n100 CLUB MERCH OUT NOW! https://represent.com/store/pewdiepie (Thank you)\nJubilee og vid: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5TGgJF7LIo\n\nPewdiepie's Pixelings DOWNLOAD:\niOS: https://buff.ly/2pNG0aT\nAndroid: https://buff.ly/34C68nZ\n#pewdiepie #pixelings\n\nMinecraft Playlist:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhgS6...\n\nMy Stores:\nTSUKI:\nhttps://tsuki.market/\nMerch:\nhttps://represent.com/store/pewdiepie\n\nI drink GFUEL (affiliate link):\nhttps://gfuel.ly/31Kargr\n\nMy Setup (affiliate links):\nChair: https://clutchchairz.com/pewdiepie/\nOfficial Razer hardware:\nRazer Nari Ultimate headset: http://rzr.to/pdp-razer-nari \nRazer Customs phone cases: http://rzr.to/pdp-razer-case\n\nNordVPN DOWNLOAD (affiliate link):\nGo to https://NordVPN.com/pewdiepie and use code PEWDIEPIE to get 70% off a 3 year plan plus 1 additional month free.\n\nI stream on DLive (ad):\nhttps://go.dlive.tv/pewdiepie", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jEExcR41NTQ/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jEExcR41NTQ/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jEExcR41NTQ/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jEExcR41NTQ/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jEExcR41NTQ/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "channelTitle": "PewDiePie", "tags": ["SATIRE"], "categoryId": "24", "liveBroadcastContent": "none", "defaultLanguage": "en-US", "localized": {"title": "6 Vegans Vs 1 Meat Eater", "description": "vegan now lads\n100 CLUB MERCH OUT NOW! https://represent.com/store/pewdiepie (Thank you)\nJubilee og vid: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5TGgJF7LIo\n\nPewdiepie's Pixelings DOWNLOAD:\niOS: https://buff.ly/2pNG0aT\nAndroid: https://buff.ly/34C68nZ\n#pewdiepie #pixelings\n\nMinecraft Playlist:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhgS6...\n\nMy Stores:\nTSUKI:\nhttps://tsuki.market/\nMerch:\nhttps://represent.com/store/pewdiepie\n\nI drink GFUEL (affiliate link):\nhttps://gfuel.ly/31Kargr\n\nMy Setup (affiliate links):\nChair: https://clutchchairz.com/pewdiepie/\nOfficial Razer hardware:\nRazer Nari Ultimate headset: http://rzr.to/pdp-razer-nari \nRazer Customs phone cases: http://rzr.to/pdp-razer-case\n\nNordVPN DOWNLOAD (affiliate link):\nGo to https://NordVPN.com/pewdiepie and use code PEWDIEPIE to get 70% off a 3 year plan plus 1 additional month free.\n\nI stream on DLive (ad):\nhttps://go.dlive.tv/pewdiepie"}, "defaultAudioLanguage": "en-GB"}, "contentDetails": {"duration": "PT17M", "dimension": "2d", "definition": "hd", "caption": "false", "licensedContent": true, "contentRating": {}, "projection": "rectangular"}, "statistics": {"viewCount": "2009954", "likeCount": "239042", "dislikeCount": "2450", "favoriteCount": "0", "commentCount": "29907"}}, {"kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "8-1tJatKggetJ7QL7wDMIxvNH0k", "id": "a0cewZtnaWM", "snippet": {"publishedAt": "2020-04-04T20:37:12Z", "channelId": "UCvUmwreRrbxeR1mbmojj8fg", "title": "How I got away with No-No juice at School", "description": "Ok here me out...\nSUB TO MY NEW SECOND CHANNEL: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q57D33ErXsI\n\nMerch store: https://creatorink.com/collections/somethingelseyt-by-adam-ortiz\n\n\nHelp put this team together, organize crap for me, and be super duper awesome please go follow and or hire them they are great \u25ba\nDee Helm -

While movies like No Time to Die and Wonder Woman 1984 can probably survive a little disruption in their release strategies, Disney depends on its MCU projects hitting their cues in order to preserve the integrity of the overarching story that links all the series and films. Thus, the bad but predictable news that came from Disney on April 3 is especially tough for Marvel Phase 4. Let's break it down.\n\nRewinding a bit, in mid-March 2020 came the news that production on The Falcon and the Winter Soldier in Prague had been halted due to government measures in the Czech Republic intended to stem the spread of the coronavirus. Then, as it became clear that movie theaters wouldn't be opening back up any time soon, Disney was forced to reevaluate the upcoming release dates for some of its biggest films. Here's the rub: the changes that the Mouse House announced on April 3 don't just impact April and May movies. The effects on the MCU ripple all the way out to 2022.\n\nIn film, scheduling changes often have cascading consequences. The entire release schedule is designed to avoid major conflicts. If a studio releases two tent poles on the same weekend, they run the risk of cannibalizing their own ticket sales. So when you punt one big film to a later date, it often means shifting the big movie that was originally scheduled for the second date and so on, and so on.\n\nAccording to Variety, Disney's new release schedule includes some major changes to Marvel Phase 4 projects, including Black Widow, The Eternals, Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, and the fourth Thor movie, Thor: Love and Thunder. Other big-budget family flicks like Indiana Jones 5 and Jungle Cruise have also been affected by the changes, though the shuffling of the MCU appears to be the most significant repercussion of the rescheduling for fans and Disney both.
