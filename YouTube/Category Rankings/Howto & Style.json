Instead, Steve-O brought his antics to Gordon's kitchen while trying to do his best to keep up with Gordon. Needless to say, Steve-O came ready to have some fun....knives, hot sauce and all! His final dish and crazy stories are something some of us can relate to. \n\nFollow Steve-O on YouTube here: https://www.youtube.com/user/steveo\nGet Steve-O's Hot Sauce here: https://hotsauceforyourbutthole.com/ \n\nGet the full recipe here: https://www.gordonramsay.com/gr/recipes/southwesternomelette \n\nFollow Gordon: \nText him: +1 (310) 620-6468\nInstagram: http://www.instagram.com/gordongram\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/gordonramsay\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/GordonRamsay"}, "defaultAudioLanguage": "en-GB"}, "contentDetails": {"duration": "PT14M10S", "dimension": "2d", "definition": "hd", "caption": "false", "licensedContent": true, "projection": "rectangular"}, "statistics": {"viewCount": "6543114", "likeCount": "253735", "dislikeCount": "3864", "favoriteCount": "0", "commentCount": "15984"}}, {"kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "\"xwzn9fn_LczrfK9QS3iZcGzqRGs/WfnHQprQGOu3neJv4oisnQLN1Eo\"", "id": "Es81Qf2_tNc", "snippet": {"publishedAt": "2020-03-29T02:37:34.000Z", "channelId": "UC6MSzdTnry2uynOWIB-tSDg", "title": "Truth about the Hype House", "description": "i just wanted to share my story... but also stay tuned for monday! big news! \nstalk me :)\ninsta @daisykeech\ntiktok @ daisykeech\ntwitter @daisykeech\nsnapchat @daisyapril", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Es81Qf2_tNc/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Es81Qf2_tNc/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Es81Qf2_tNc/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Es81Qf2_tNc/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Es81Qf2_tNc/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "channelTitle": "Daisy Keech", "tags": ["hype house", "truth about hype house", "thomas petrou and daisy keech", "daisykeech hype house", "thomas petrou hype house", "chase hudson hype house"], "categoryId": "22", "liveBroadcastContent": "none", "localized": {"title": "Truth about the Hype House", "description": "i just wanted to share my story... but also stay tuned for monday! big news! \nstalk me :)\ninsta @daisykeech\ntiktok @ daisykeech\ntwitter @daisykeech\nsnapchat @daisyapril"}, "defaultAudioLanguage": "en"}, "contentDetails": {"duration": "PT22M50S", "dimension": "2d", "definition": "hd", "caption": "false", "licensedContent": false, "projection": "rectangular"}, "statistics": {"viewCount": "6658077", "likeCount": "468581", "dislikeCount": "10703", "favoriteCount": "0", "commentCount": "39666"}}, {"kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "\"xwzn9fn_LczrfK9QS3iZcGzqRGs/XCk3sDKJ0QqVoTm1h-KCWY-3J9w\"", "id": "AhGUBjK10DI", "snippet": {"publishedAt": "2020-04-02T23:18:24.000Z", "channelId": "UCXrEE1TyCslZgsH1Pql51-Q", "title": "DIY Face Mask with Elastic in 10 minutes - Sewing Tutorial", "description": "Blog post with more! https://melaniekham.com/homemade-face-mask/\n\nI have been hesitant to post a tutorial for these because there has been a lot of debate around how effective they are.
