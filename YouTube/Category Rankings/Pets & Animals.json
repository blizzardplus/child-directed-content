We have a small plot of land, but boy, do we make the most of it. Each animal on our farm is taken care of holistically & organically. We let the mama goats raise their babies until they reach 10 weeks of age and are naturally weaned from nursing. We keep a small herd of 5-7 milking goats, mainly the Nigerian Dwarf breed, although we still have the queen of the herd, Luna, our Nubian goat. We use the fresh goat's milk to make cheese, butter, cream, and we use it in all sorts of baking & cooking. We love that we can walk into our backyard and gather food. It's the best feeling ever!\n\nAfter the morning chores, we usually tend to the pond -- we're always adding new pond plants and fish to maintain the delicate ecosystem of our natural swimming pool. Our backyard farm is full of adventures, and we're so happy to share our farm vlog with you.

Let us know if you spot the animal hidden in\nsome of the photos we are going to show you today. But I\u2019m warning you, it\u2019s not going to be easy.\nToday we will be taking a look at 10 animals with super camouflage that really exist. Number one is so\ngood at hiding itself that you wouldn\u2019t believe that they are so common. Stay tuned to find out what\nanimal it is!\n\nNumber 10. The Dead Leaf Mantis\nhttps://static.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/amazing-wild-animal-camouflage-\nnature-51-592817f757336__700.jpg\nThis cryptic mantis lives to mimic dead leaves hence the name and is considered to be one of the most\nbeautiful mantids out there. Their coloring ranges from dark brown to light brown or somewhere in the\nbrown scope. They also possess a broad prothorax that looks ripped and crumpled like a leaf. When\nthreatened, the dead leaf mantis will freeze and throw itself to the ground with all legs folded to look\nlike a dead leaf.\nClearly, this insects camouflage is extremely effective. Just look at this photo. Not only does the mantis\ncopy the color of dead leaves perfectly, but it also effectively mimics the jagged edges of dead leaves. I\nimagine that if this guy would remain motionless in a pile of dead leaves, I wouldn\u2019t stand a chance of\neven spotting it. This insect\u2019s only giveaway is a pair of big, stunningly beautiful, pitch black eyes which\neasily stands out against the brown background.\nRecently, these mantids have become a very popular pet for those with the taste of the exotic.\n\nNumber 9. The Impala\nhttps://static.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/amazing-wild-animal-camouflage-\nnature-23-5926a0613d131__700.jpg\nTell me honestly, look at this photo and tell me if you can see an animal. You don\u2019t? I guarantee you that\nthere is. Actually, it took me a few minutes to spot it because it is so well camouflaged. The animal so\nexpertly hidden in this photo is the impala.\nImpalas are medium-sized antelopes that roam the savanna and light woodlands of eastern and\nsouthern Africa. In the rainy season, when food is plentiful, they may gather in large herds of several\nhundred animals to browse on grasses and herbs, bushes, shrubs, and shoots.\nHerds offer protection from predators, such as lions. An alert impala will bark out an alarm that puts the\nentire herd to flight\u2014and a fleeing impala is no easy prey.\nImpalas are fleet runners who are able to leap distances of up to 33 feet. They use this technique to\nescape predators and sometimes, apparently, simply to amuse themselves. The impala can also clear\nbushes and other obstacles by soaring some 10 feet in the air. Typically, a running impala will simply\njump over anything in its path.\n\nBut when the protection of the herd isn\u2019t enough, and fleeing at great speed is not an option, impalas,\nespecially the young ones, can easily blend in the tall grass.\n\nNumber 8. The Copperhead Snake\nhttps://static.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/amazing-wild-animal-camouflage-\nnature-33-5926c8eea6c0b__700.jpg\nHere\u2019s a photo of a typical forest floor. Do you see anything unusual? Me neither, but that only attests\nto how amazing this animal\u2019s camouflage is. The thing is, this is one animal that you would want to spot\nimmediately.\nCopperheads get their name from their bronze-hued heads. These large snakes, found through the\nsouthern and eastern United States, have bodies that range from tan to copper to gray, with\ncharacteristic hourglass-shaped stripes. The reptiles grow to lengths between two and three feet,\nalthough there are records of individuals longer than four feet. Their stout bodies abruptly taper toward\ntheir thin tails.\nThey are responsible for more venomous snakebites than any other in the United States, in part because\nthey are widespread and populous. They can also tolerate living in subdivisions and developed land,\nmaking interactions with humans more common. But they are most at home living in the woods, where\ntheir intricately patterned back blends in perfectly with the forest floor.\n\nNumber 7.
